The NC demanded that authority be given to such a committee to carry out investigations into the cooperative fraud case and bring out the truth.

Speaker Devraj Ghimire allotted time to NC lawmaker Ram Krishna Yadav after all the NC lawmakers stood from their respective seats as a protest in today's meeting of the House of Representatives (HoR).

Speaking in the meeting, lawmaker Yadav pointed out the need for a parliamentary probe into the cooperative fraud case, citing that a crisis of trust has surfaced after the investigation against Lamichhane was stopped with reconstitution of the government.

He said Home Minister Lamichhane should resign from the post based on ethics as he had taken a loan of Rs 800 million from a cooperative at a time when he was working at Gorkha Media Pvt Ltd and has still not cleared it.

Lawmaker Yadav also demanded an investigation against Minister for Labor, Employment and Social Security, DP Aryal, as he, too, has been found to be involved in another cooperative case, clarifying his party would not obstruct the House on other issues except the issues connected with the Home Ministry and Cooperative.

Urging the government to seriously pay attention to the issues raised by lawmakers in the House, he urged the government to raise hope among the people by ending impunity, and maintaining rule of law and good governance.

In response, Speaker Ghimire said his and the House's attention had been drawn to the issues raised by lawmaker Yadav.",Republica,2024-08-08
