Bhattarai, who was a candidate from Gorkha-2, decided after holding discussions today with several leaders close to him.

He had filed his candidacy on behalf of the Progressive Democratic Party.

According to sources at his secretariat, the decision was made after Nepal Communist Party coordinator Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’, Nepali Congress candidate Prakash Chandra Dawadi, and Rastriya Swatantra Party Vice Chair Swarnim Wagle, among others, requested him to play a guardian-like role and facilitate consensus. Bhattarai will formally withdraw his candidacy today through a legal representative.

Bhattarai has previously been elected from Gorkha-2. In the 2079 BS election, he had supported Prachanda and stated that he would not contest. This time as well, he had repeatedly said he would not run in the election, but decided to do so just two days before the nomination and travelled to Gorkha. He has not disclosed whom he will support after withdrawing his candidacy.

Candidates in Gorkha-2 include Prakash Chandra Dawadi of the Nepali Congress, Milan Gurung (Milan Chakre) of the CPN-UML, Kabindra Burlakoti, General Secretary of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, among others.",OnlineKhabar,2026-01-23
