He had just returned from school.

“There was a loud noise; I could not hear anything for a while,” Sujal, 13, told the Post on Monday afternoon. “I was scared.”

One person was killed in the explosion and another injured.

The cooking gas cylinder had gone off in the room adjacent to Dhamala’s room.

Dhamala’s mother, Sakun, had left the room only a while ago after preparing snacks for her son. The 36-year-old, who works as a cook at Churiya Mai Hostel, was just three blocks from the house where the incident happened.

“I thought the blast took place in my room,” Sakun told the Post. “I was extremely worried because the explosion time coincided with the time my son returns from school.”

There was yet another blast in Sukedhara also on Sunday, in which three people were killed. According to police, cadres of the Netra Bikram Chand-led Communist Party of Nepal were trying to rig the cylinders as explosives with a plan to plant them somewhere in the Capital on Monday, coinciding with their nationwide strike.

Officials said the improvised devices, however, went off accidentally.

The Chand party, whose activities have been banned by the government, has unleashed terror among people, in a grim reminder of the days during the Maoist insurgency.

Since the government decided to brand the Chand party a criminal outfit and launch actions against its members, the party has been in a retaliation mode.

While the government has intensified action against the Chand party, it says the door for talks is open.

But security experts and analysts say the government’s approach to dealing with the party, a breakaway faction of the Maoist party that waged a decade-long insurgency, is faulty.

“The government’s way of dealing with the Chand party has largely failed. It is trying to use stick first and dangle the carrot later. It’s trying to use force before seeking to hold talks,” said Indra Adhikari, a security expert. “As a guardian, the government should use different channels and take initiatives to bring the Chand party to dialogue,” she said.

Experts said the government’s wrong approach had provoked the Chand outfit and its actions now have unleashed terror among the people.

“It looks like the organisational set-up of the Chand outfit remains intact,” said Binoj Basnyat, a retired major general of the Nepal Army, who writes on security issues. “Government actions have not affected their resources, nor have they lost people’s support—at least that’s how it appears.”

According to Basnyat, the government now has two options.

“The government should either change its approach and deal with the outfit politically,” he said. “Or it should, if it can, contain the outfit by using force.”

Chand, a firebrand Maoist leader during the conflict, had left the Maoist party led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal in 2012, along with two other senior leaders—Mohan Baidya and Ram Bahadur Thapa. The three leaders had accused Dahal of leaving the “people’s war” halfway when they joined the peace process in 2006.

In 2014, following disagreements over the principle to launch a new revolution, Chand left Baidya and Thapa to form his own party—the Communist Party of Nepal. But Thapa, two years later, returned to Dahal’s fold and is now the home minister, pitting him against Chand and his outfit.

The explosions on Sunday occurred on the eve of the Chand party’s nationwide strike demanding an investigation into the death of its cadre Tirtha Raj Ghimire.

Meanwhile, police have identified the person who was killed in Ghattekulo explosion as Bishal Shahi from Achham. He was a member of the student union affiliated to the radical force.

Shahi’s friend, Rabin KC from Rukum, also a member of the Chand party’s student wing, was injured.

“Had I known they would get involved in making bombs, I would not have kept them as tenants,” said Lokranjan Karki, the house owner. “My house is damaged, but that apart, it has put us in trouble.”

When the Post visited the area on Monday afternoon, tension still ran high.

Meanwhile, in the Ghattekulo neighbourhood, people were concerned about security, as reports continued to trickle in about security forces defusing improvised explosive devices in other parts of the Capital.

Hema Koirala, who owns a grocery shop in Ghattekulo near the house where the blast occurred, said it was a terrifying scene on Sunday.

“I have not mustered up the courage to open the shop today,” said Koirala. “Earlier such strikes did not have much effect. But yesterday’s blasts have left us terrified. We are worried about our security.",Kathmandu Post,2019-05-27
2,Politics,https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2019/05/27/home-minister-says-those-killed-in-blasts-were-not-citizens-angering-opposition,,"Minister for Home Affairs Ram Bahadur Thapa said on Monday that those killed in a series of blasts on Sunday across the Capital were not citizens, inviting criticism from lawmakers over his labelling of the Netra Bikram Chand-led communist party cadres as non-citizens.

Taking a special time in the House of Representatives on Monday, Thapa said Chand’s party was carrying out anti-national and unconstitutional terror activities.

Sunday’s blasts were a result of technical lapses while manufacturing the bombs to create terror for a so-called nationwide strike on Monday. “Those killed in the incident were not citizens but cadres of the Biplav-led group,” he told the House.

In recent months, Thapa has been extremely critical of Chand, who used to be his comrade during the Maoist insurgency that took nearly 17,000 lives.

The Maoist party, of which Thapa was a key leader, was also once branded by then government as a terrorist group for its campaign of violence and terror.

Thapa’s relation with Chand was also special at one point in time, as they together deserted the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Maoist party in 2012, accusing it of deviating from its political ideology and leaving the “people’s war” halfway.

But four years later, Thapa returned to Dahal’s fold and is now the home minister.

On Monday, when lawmakers criticised Thapa, asking him who the Chand outfit members were if not Nepali citizens, the home minister modified his comment and said they were not “common citizens” and that those involved in the terror activities cannot be considered ordinary citizens.

Four people died and at least seven others were injured in around half a dozen blasts in the Capital and Nawalparasi on Sunday and early Monday. Three people died when a pressure cooker bomb exploded inside a hair salon in Sukedhara and the fourth person died in a bomb explosion in Ghattekulo. Two people were injured in a blast at Chandragiri Municipality. The government claimed that all those killed in the blasts and a majority of the injured were members of the Chand’s party.

Human right advocates, however, say the government cannot say that someone is not a citizen just because they are involved in criminal activities.

“Even a criminal has rights as a citizen,” said Charan Prasain, a human rights campaigner. He said the home minister was also wrong to create separate groups for common citizens since there is no legal categorisation of citizens.

More than 24 hours after the deadly blasts, there has been no public statement from the prime minister on the deadly blasts that shook the Capital on Sunday night. However, in a separate event on Monday, KP Sharma Oli called the Chand-led party “a terrorist group.”

Speaking at the anniversary event of the National Human Rights Commission, Oli said the terrorist group had been resorting to violence to terrorise people.

“Chand’s party neither has any ideology nor any goals,” the prime minister said. “The sole motive is to extort people by terrorising them.”",Kathmandu Post,2019-05-27
3,Politics,https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2019/05/28/confusion-grips-three-tiers-of-government-over-division-of-royalties-from-natural-resources,,"Mount Everest is not only the highest peak in the world but also one of the highest sources of revenue from tourism in Nepal. Every year, aspiring climbers pay thousands of dollars to scale the mountain, generating much income for the country.

But Nepal’s new federal set-up has created confusion over how this income should be shared, leading to rifts between the local governments in Solukhumbu district, where the mountain is located. As per the Act for Intergovernmental Fiscal Arrangement, the federal government receives 50 percent of the royalty from Mount Everest while the provincial government gets 25 percent and local government(s) receive the remaining 25 percent.

Everest lies in the Khumbu Pasanglhamu Rural Municipality, which stakes its claim to all of the remaining 25 percent.

But the seven other municipalities and rural municipalities in the district disagree, demanding their share of the revenue, since Everest lies in their district.

“Of the 25 percent to be received by the local government, Pasanglhamu Rural Municipality wants the entire 25 percent because Everest lies in that rural municipality,” said Namaraj Ghimire, an information officer at the National Natural Resources and Fiscal Commission. “But the other local governments in the district say they too should benefit from the royalties.”

This spring climbing season, which concludes on Monday with the last batch of climbers waiting to scale the mountain, mountaineers paid the government Rs441.38 million in total to summit Everest, according to the Department of Tourism.

The National Natural Resources and Fiscal Commission has been holding consultations at the central, provincial and local levels to come up with a formula for the sharing of royalties from natural resources, he said.

The formula is expected to help provincial and local governments estimate the amount they will be receiving next fiscal year as royalties from natural resources and prepare their budget accordingly. In the absence of this formula, the commission has yet to recommend the sharing of royalties collected last fiscal year.

As per the law, royalties can be raised through mountaineering, electricity, forests, mines, minerals, water and other natural resources.

Officials at the commission, however, said that there is a lot of confusion over the definition of royalty, who should be the beneficiaries, how that should be determined, and how the different layers of government should invest in the development of natural resources.

“The local governments award contracts for extracting stones and sand but there is confusion over whether the amounts the contractors pay should be considered royalty,” said Gopikrishna Khanal, the commission’s spokesperson.

As the law does not clearly define who should be the beneficiaries of royalties from natural resources, competing claims from different quarters have emerged, said officials.

“For example, people living in the areas where hydropower projects are located may claim that they should be the only beneficiaries, but people from areas where transmission lines are constructed may also demand a share of the royalties,” said Khanal.

Given this confusion, the commission had recently conducted a study, with assistance from the World Bank, on how the beneficiaries should be determined.

According to Khanal, the study has recommended determining three layers of beneficiaries, based on people from the core area, the adjoining area and the surrounding area of the natural resources.

“As the study has not suggested how much of the royalties should be provided to people from the three layers, the commission needs to carry out more work,” said Khanal.

According to the Act on Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer, both the local level and district coordination committees should be beneficiaries. However, commission officials said that there is still concern over whether local and provincial governments will be ready to accept the criteria for royalty distribution as determined by the commission.

Royalty could become a conflicting issue in the future, although open conflict has not yet appeared, said experts on federalism.

“There needs to be clarity on the modality of royalty distribution and this should be done by prioritising the local people as per the spirit of the constitution,” said Khim Lal Devkota, an expert on federal issues and vice-chairman of the Province 3 Policy Commission.",Kathmandu Post,2019-05-28
4,Politics,https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2019/05/31/dahal-brings-up-deal-with-oli-again-leading-to-suspicion-among-party-members,,"A recent remark by Nepal Communist Party Co-chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal regarding an agreement with Prime Minister and another co-chair KP Sharma Oli is leading some within the ruling party to wonder if a potential powerplay is brewing.

In a televised interview broadcast on Wednesday on Prime Television, Dahal brought up the five-point agreement signed between him and Oli a day before the unification of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) and the CPN-UML to form the Nepal Communist Party (NCP). The fourth point of the agreement states that the co-chairs will lead the government for equal periods of time.

Given that the party received a five-year term last elections, government leadership should’ve been divided equally between Oli and Dahal at two-and-a-half years each. Oli has already been in office for 15 months, and if the agreement is abided by, he only has 15 more months to go.

In the interview, Dahal said that nobody would be spared, not even himself, if the agreement is violated.

“It looks like Dahal has started to warn Oli,” said a central member of the party representing the former Maoists. “This indicates that there must be some misunderstanding between the two leaders.”

Though Dahal raised the issue of the deal, he also said that Oli could continue for the entire five-year term provided that the government steers clear of controversies.

Although the agreement is common knowledge within the party, some leaders, especially those from the erstwhile UML party, are wondering at the timing of Dahal’s statement, as Oli is currently in India for Narendra Modi’s oath-taking ceremony.

“The agreement is a known fact, but the mystery is in the timing of Dahal’s statement,” said Surya Thapa, a central committee member. “Why did he choose a time when Oli is absent?”

Time and again, Dahal has brought up the agreement, in what observers say is an attempt to remind Oli of the deal. This is the second time in three days that Dahal has spoken of the agreement. Earlier, on Monday, in response to a reporter’s question in Biratnagar, Dahal had said that the agreement was already out and things would move ahead accordingly.

In the past, Dahal’s repeated references to the agreement had irked Oli, who had asked him not to make any more statements. Dahal agreed to stop, saying it could affect the performance of the government.

But Ghanashyam Bhusal, a Standing Committee member, said people are talking about the issue “now” because Dahal has made the statement regarding the pact.

“Everyone knows about this agreement and talks around it would have emerged some day,” said Bhusal. “It [the statement] is but obvious.”

Dahal, a two-time prime minister, has had a bitter experience regarding power-sharing with Oli. In 2016, Oli had refused to hand over the reins to Dahal, despite a gentleman’s agreement to that end. Dahal had then been forced to side with the Nepali Congress, which is currently the main opposition.

Some ruling party leaders of late have been raising the issue of “one leader, one position” in the party, which largely means if Oli continues as the prime minister, Dahal should lead the party.

During the latest Standing Committee meeting held in the last week of December, Bamdev Gautam, a Secretariat member, had submitted his own political document proposing that the party should adopt a system in which one leader should not be taking dual responsibilities.

But given the agreement reached between Oli and Dahal, it is unlikely that the former Maoist leader would be content with running the party, while letting the former continue.

However, one member of the party’s secretariat said that despite the agreement, it will be extremely difficult for Dahal to take the reins of government from Oli. Hence, Dahal’s public statements are geared towards exerting pressure on Oli.

Some former UML leaders have also started to question Dahal’s intent, saying he is inclined to take sole leadership of the party if he is not allowed to lead the government.

“Dahal seems focused on individual leadership of the party, but that is not possible as the UML rank and file still have not accepted him,” said Thapa, who is said to be close to Oli. “The party will continue with dual leadership even after its national convention as doubts remain.”",Kathmandu Post,2019-05-31
5,Politics,https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2019/05/31/education-budget-courts-criticism,,"The National Campaign for Education, an umbrella body of 339 organisations working for the promotion of public education, has said that the government failed to take any tangible steps to meet its global commitment to allocate 20 percent of the national budget in the education sector.

The budget for the fiscal year 2019-20, presented by Finance Minister Yubaraj Khatiwada on Wednesday, has not allocated enough resource for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in Education, which envisions ensuring inclusive and quality education, the campaign said in a statement on Thursday.

“We demand that the government allocate at least 20 percent budget in the education sector and ensure local and provincial governments get adequate budget,” said the statement issued by Kumar Bhattarai, chairperson of the campaign.

The campaign has also questioned the government’s commitment to improve the quality of education in public schools for not publicising the report of the High Level National Education Commission.

Despite repeated demands from members of the commission and non-government educational organisations, the government is yet to make public the report that was submitted four months ago.

The commission had handed over the report to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli in the presence of Minister for Education, Science and Technology Giriraj Mani Pokharel on January 15.

The report was prepared to create the basis for the formulation of an education policy in the changed political context.The campaign has also criticised the budget for giving little attention to local governments, which bear the entire responsibility of managing school education.

“The tendency to keep maximum share of the budget under the prerogative of the federal government shows it is not interested in strengthening the local government,” reads the statement.Only around one-third of the national budget has been earmarked to the local and provincial governments.Overall, the total budget to be received by the provincial and local governments for the next fiscal year stands at Rs 464 billion, which is 30 percent of the Rs 1.53 trillion budget.Seven provincial governments and 753 local units received 33.66 percent of the national budget in the running fiscal year. Prior to the budget formulation, a delegation led by the campaign had met with Minister Khatiwada and drew his attention to Nepal’s global commitment to allocate at least one-fifth of the national budget or—6.5 percent of the GDP—in the education sector.

The government failed to keep the pledge while presenting the national budget for the upcoming fiscal year. The campaign has welcomed some aspects of the education budget such as midday meal scheme, education in mother tongue, disabled-friendly infrastructure, scholarship for girls and free distribution of sanitary pads in schools as progressive steps.",Kathmandu Post,2019-05-31
