He had just returned from school.

“There was a loud noise; I could not hear anything for a while,” Sujal, 13, told the Post on Monday afternoon. “I was scared.”

One person was killed in the explosion and another injured.

The cooking gas cylinder had gone off in the room adjacent to Dhamala’s room.

Dhamala’s mother, Sakun, had left the room only a while ago after preparing snacks for her son. The 36-year-old, who works as a cook at Churiya Mai Hostel, was just three blocks from the house where the incident happened.

“I thought the blast took place in my room,” Sakun told the Post. “I was extremely worried because the explosion time coincided with the time my son returns from school.”

There was yet another blast in Sukedhara also on Sunday, in which three people were killed. According to police, cadres of the Netra Bikram Chand-led Communist Party of Nepal were trying to rig the cylinders as explosives with a plan to plant them somewhere in the Capital on Monday, coinciding with their nationwide strike.

Officials said the improvised devices, however, went off accidentally.

The Chand party, whose activities have been banned by the government, has unleashed terror among people, in a grim reminder of the days during the Maoist insurgency.

Since the government decided to brand the Chand party a criminal outfit and launch actions against its members, the party has been in a retaliation mode.

While the government has intensified action against the Chand party, it says the door for talks is open.

But security experts and analysts say the government’s approach to dealing with the party, a breakaway faction of the Maoist party that waged a decade-long insurgency, is faulty.

“The government’s way of dealing with the Chand party has largely failed. It is trying to use stick first and dangle the carrot later. It’s trying to use force before seeking to hold talks,” said Indra Adhikari, a security expert. “As a guardian, the government should use different channels and take initiatives to bring the Chand party to dialogue,” she said.

Experts said the government’s wrong approach had provoked the Chand outfit and its actions now have unleashed terror among the people.

“It looks like the organisational set-up of the Chand outfit remains intact,” said Binoj Basnyat, a retired major general of the Nepal Army, who writes on security issues. “Government actions have not affected their resources, nor have they lost people’s support—at least that’s how it appears.”

According to Basnyat, the government now has two options.

“The government should either change its approach and deal with the outfit politically,” he said. “Or it should, if it can, contain the outfit by using force.”

Chand, a firebrand Maoist leader during the conflict, had left the Maoist party led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal in 2012, along with two other senior leaders—Mohan Baidya and Ram Bahadur Thapa. The three leaders had accused Dahal of leaving the “people’s war” halfway when they joined the peace process in 2006.

In 2014, following disagreements over the principle to launch a new revolution, Chand left Baidya and Thapa to form his own party—the Communist Party of Nepal. But Thapa, two years later, returned to Dahal’s fold and is now the home minister, pitting him against Chand and his outfit.

The explosions on Sunday occurred on the eve of the Chand party’s nationwide strike demanding an investigation into the death of its cadre Tirtha Raj Ghimire.

Meanwhile, police have identified the person who was killed in Ghattekulo explosion as Bishal Shahi from Achham. He was a member of the student union affiliated to the radical force.

Shahi’s friend, Rabin KC from Rukum, also a member of the Chand party’s student wing, was injured.

“Had I known they would get involved in making bombs, I would not have kept them as tenants,” said Lokranjan Karki, the house owner. “My house is damaged, but that apart, it has put us in trouble.”

When the Post visited the area on Monday afternoon, tension still ran high.

Meanwhile, in the Ghattekulo neighbourhood, people were concerned about security, as reports continued to trickle in about security forces defusing improvised explosive devices in other parts of the Capital.

Hema Koirala, who owns a grocery shop in Ghattekulo near the house where the blast occurred, said it was a terrifying scene on Sunday.

“I have not mustered up the courage to open the shop today,” said Koirala. “Earlier such strikes did not have much effect. But yesterday’s blasts have left us terrified. We are worried about our security.",Kathmandu Post,2019-05-27
2,Politics,https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2019/05/27/home-minister-says-those-killed-in-blasts-were-not-citizens-angering-opposition,"Home minister says those killed in blasts were not citizens, angering opposition: Ram Bahadur Thapa, in recent months, has been extremely critical of Chand, once his ally.","Minister for Home Affairs Ram Bahadur Thapa said on Monday that those killed in a series of blasts on Sunday across the Capital were not citizens, inviting criticism from lawmakers over his labelling of the Netra Bikram Chand-led communist party cadres as non-citizens.

Taking a special time in the House of Representatives on Monday, Thapa said Chand’s party was carrying out anti-national and unconstitutional terror activities.

Sunday’s blasts were a result of technical lapses while manufacturing the bombs to create terror for a so-called nationwide strike on Monday. “Those killed in the incident were not citizens but cadres of the Biplav-led group,” he told the House.

[Read: Sunday's blasts indicative of an intelligence failure, analysts say]

In recent months, Thapa has been extremely critical of Chand, who used to be his comrade during the Maoist insurgency that took nearly 17,000 lives.

The Maoist party, of which Thapa was a key leader, was also once branded by then government as a terrorist group for its campaign of violence and terror.

Thapa’s relation with Chand was also special at one point in time, as they together deserted the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Maoist party in 2012, accusing it of deviating from its political ideology and leaving the “people’s war” halfway.

But four years later, Thapa returned to Dahal’s fold and is now the home minister.

On Monday, when lawmakers criticised Thapa, asking him who the Chand outfit members were if not Nepali citizens, the home minister modified his comment and said they were not “common citizens” and that those involved in the terror activities cannot be considered ordinary citizens.

Four people died and at least seven others were injured in around half a dozen blasts in the Capital and Nawalparasi on Sunday and early Monday. Three people died when a pressure cooker bomb exploded inside a hair salon in Sukedhara and the fourth person died in a bomb explosion in Ghattekulo. Two people were injured in a blast at Chandragiri Municipality. The government claimed that all those killed in the blasts and a majority of the injured were members of the Chand’s party.

Human right advocates, however, say the government cannot say that someone is not a citizen just because they are involved in criminal activities.

“Even a criminal has rights as a citizen,” said Charan Prasain, a human rights campaigner. He said the home minister was also wrong to create separate groups for common citizens since there is no legal categorisation of citizens.

More than 24 hours after the deadly blasts, there has been no public statement from the prime minister on the deadly blasts that shook the Capital on Sunday night. However, in a separate event on Monday, KP Sharma Oli called the Chand-led party “a terrorist group.”

Speaking at the anniversary event of the National Human Rights Commission, Oli said the terrorist group had been resorting to violence to terrorise people.

“Chand’s party neither has any ideology nor any goals,” the prime minister said. “The sole motive is to extort people by terrorising them.”",Kathmandu Post,2019-05-27
3,Politics,https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2019/05/28/confusion-grips-three-tiers-of-government-over-division-of-royalties-from-natural-resources,Confusion grips three tiers of government over division of royalties from natural resources: The National Natural Resources and Fiscal Commission is working on a formula for royalty sharing but no clear modality has been found yet,"Mount Everest is not only the highest peak in the world but also one of the highest sources of revenue from tourism in Nepal. Every year, aspiring climbers pay thousands of dollars to scale the mountain, generating much income for the country.

But Nepal’s new federal set-up has created confusion over how this income should be shared, leading to rifts between the local governments in Solukhumbu district, where the mountain is located. As per the Act for Intergovernmental Fiscal Arrangement, the federal government receives 50 percent of the royalty from Mount Everest while the provincial government gets 25 percent and local government(s) receive the remaining 25 percent.

Everest lies in the Khumbu Pasanglhamu Rural Municipality, which stakes its claim to all of the remaining 25 percent.

But the seven other municipalities and rural municipalities in the district disagree, demanding their share of the revenue, since Everest lies in their district.

“Of the 25 percent to be received by the local government, Pasanglhamu Rural Municipality wants the entire 25 percent because Everest lies in that rural municipality,” said Namaraj Ghimire, an information officer at the National Natural Resources and Fiscal Commission. “But the other local governments in the district say they too should benefit from the royalties.”

This spring climbing season, which concludes on Monday with the last batch of climbers waiting to scale the mountain, mountaineers paid the government Rs441.38 million in total to summit Everest, according to the Department of Tourism.

The National Natural Resources and Fiscal Commission has been holding consultations at the central, provincial and local levels to come up with a formula for the sharing of royalties from natural resources, he said.

The formula is expected to help provincial and local governments estimate the amount they will be receiving next fiscal year as royalties from natural resources and prepare their budget accordingly. In the absence of this formula, the commission has yet to recommend the sharing of royalties collected last fiscal year.

As per the law, royalties can be raised through mountaineering, electricity, forests, mines, minerals, water and other natural resources.

Officials at the commission, however, said that there is a lot of confusion over the definition of royalty, who should be the beneficiaries, how that should be determined, and how the different layers of government should invest in the development of natural resources.

“The local governments award contracts for extracting stones and sand but there is confusion over whether the amounts the contractors pay should be considered royalty,” said Gopikrishna Khanal, the commission’s spokesperson.

As the law does not clearly define who should be the beneficiaries of royalties from natural resources, competing claims from different quarters have emerged, said officials.

“For example, people living in the areas where hydropower projects are located may claim that they should be the only beneficiaries, but people from areas where transmission lines are constructed may also demand a share of the royalties,” said Khanal.

Given this confusion, the commission had recently conducted a study, with assistance from the World Bank, on how the beneficiaries should be determined.

According to Khanal, the study has recommended determining three layers of beneficiaries, based on people from the core area, the adjoining area and the surrounding area of the natural resources.

“As the study has not suggested how much of the royalties should be provided to people from the three layers, the commission needs to carry out more work,” said Khanal.

According to the Act on Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer, both the local level and district coordination committees should be beneficiaries. However, commission officials said that there is still concern over whether local and provincial governments will be ready to accept the criteria for royalty distribution as determined by the commission.

Royalty could become a conflicting issue in the future, although open conflict has not yet appeared, said experts on federalism.

“There needs to be clarity on the modality of royalty distribution and this should be done by prioritising the local people as per the spirit of the constitution,” said Khim Lal Devkota, an expert on federal issues and vice-chairman of the Province 3 Policy Commission.",Kathmandu Post,2019-05-28
4,Politics,https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2019/05/31/dahal-brings-up-deal-with-oli-again-leading-to-suspicion-among-party-members,"Dahal brings up agreement with Oli again, leading to suspicion among party members: For the second time in three days, Dahal made reference to an agreement which states that the party co-chairs will share government leadership.","A recent remark by Nepal Communist Party Co-chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal regarding an agreement with Prime Minister and another co-chair KP Sharma Oli is leading some within the ruling party to wonder if a potential powerplay is brewing.

In a televised interview broadcast on Wednesday on Prime Television, Dahal brought up the five-point agreement signed between him and Oli a day before the unification of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) and the CPN-UML to form the Nepal Communist Party (NCP). The fourth point of the agreement states that the co-chairs will lead the government for equal periods of time.

Given that the party received a five-year term last elections, government leadership should’ve been divided equally between Oli and Dahal at two-and-a-half years each. Oli has already been in office for 15 months, and if the agreement is abided by, he only has 15 more months to go.

In the interview, Dahal said that nobody would be spared, not even himself, if the agreement is violated.

“It looks like Dahal has started to warn Oli,” said a central member of the party representing the former Maoists. “This indicates that there must be some misunderstanding between the two leaders.”

Though Dahal raised the issue of the deal, he also said that Oli could continue for the entire five-year term provided that the government steers clear of controversies.

Although the agreement is common knowledge within the party, some leaders, especially those from the erstwhile UML party, are wondering at the timing of Dahal’s statement, as Oli is currently in India for Narendra Modi’s oath-taking ceremony.

“The agreement is a known fact, but the mystery is in the timing of Dahal’s statement,” said Surya Thapa, a central committee member. “Why did he choose a time when Oli is absent?”

Time and again, Dahal has brought up the agreement, in what observers say is an attempt to remind Oli of the deal. This is the second time in three days that Dahal has spoken of the agreement. Earlier, on Monday, in response to a reporter’s question in Biratnagar, Dahal had said that the agreement was already out and things would move ahead accordingly.

In the past, Dahal’s repeated references to the agreement had irked Oli, who had asked him not to make any more statements. Dahal agreed to stop, saying it could affect the performance of the government.

But Ghanashyam Bhusal, a Standing Committee member, said people are talking about the issue “now” because Dahal has made the statement regarding the pact.

“Everyone knows about this agreement and talks around it would have emerged some day,” said Bhusal. “It [the statement] is but obvious.”

Dahal, a two-time prime minister, has had a bitter experience regarding power-sharing with Oli. In 2016, Oli had refused to hand over the reins to Dahal, despite a gentleman’s agreement to that end. Dahal had then been forced to side with the Nepali Congress, which is currently the main opposition.

Some ruling party leaders of late have been raising the issue of “one leader, one position” in the party, which largely means if Oli continues as the prime minister, Dahal should lead the party.

During the latest Standing Committee meeting held in the last week of December, Bamdev Gautam, a Secretariat member, had submitted his own political document proposing that the party should adopt a system in which one leader should not be taking dual responsibilities.

But given the agreement reached between Oli and Dahal, it is unlikely that the former Maoist leader would be content with running the party, while letting the former continue.

However, one member of the party’s secretariat said that despite the agreement, it will be extremely difficult for Dahal to take the reins of government from Oli. Hence, Dahal’s public statements are geared towards exerting pressure on Oli.

Some former UML leaders have also started to question Dahal’s intent, saying he is inclined to take sole leadership of the party if he is not allowed to lead the government.

“Dahal seems focused on individual leadership of the party, but that is not possible as the UML rank and file still have not accepted him,” said Thapa, who is said to be close to Oli. “The party will continue with dual leadership even after its national convention as doubts remain.”",Kathmandu Post,2019-05-31

The budget for the fiscal year 2019-20, presented by Finance Minister Yubaraj Khatiwada on Wednesday, has not allocated enough resource for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in Education, which envisions ensuring inclusive and quality education, the campaign said in a statement on Thursday.

“We demand that the government allocate at least 20 percent budget in the education sector and ensure local and provincial governments get adequate budget,” said the statement issued by Kumar Bhattarai, chairperson of the campaign.

The campaign has also questioned the government’s commitment to improve the quality of education in public schools for not publicising the report of the High Level National Education Commission.

Despite repeated demands from members of the commission and non-government educational organisations, the government is yet to make public the report that was submitted four months ago.

The commission had handed over the report to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli in the presence of Minister for Education, Science and Technology Giriraj Mani Pokharel on January 15.

The report was prepared to create the basis for the formulation of an education policy in the changed political context.The campaign has also criticised the budget for giving little attention to local governments, which bear the entire responsibility of managing school education.

“The tendency to keep maximum share of the budget under the prerogative of the federal government shows it is not interested in strengthening the local government,” reads the statement.Only around one-third of the national budget has been earmarked to the local and provincial governments.Overall, the total budget to be received by the provincial and local governments for the next fiscal year stands at Rs 464 billion, which is 30 percent of the Rs 1.53 trillion budget.Seven provincial governments and 753 local units received 33.66 percent of the national budget in the running fiscal year. Prior to the budget formulation, a delegation led by the campaign had met with Minister Khatiwada and drew his attention to Nepal’s global commitment to allocate at least one-fifth of the national budget or—6.5 percent of the GDP—in the education sector.

The government failed to keep the pledge while presenting the national budget for the upcoming fiscal year. The campaign has welcomed some aspects of the education budget such as midday meal scheme, education in mother tongue, disabled-friendly infrastructure, scholarship for girls and free distribution of sanitary pads in schools as progressive steps.",Kathmandu Post,2019-05-31

The government is currently in the process of appointing new officials at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons, and conflict victims have already expressed their concerns over a repeat of the past mistakes. Four years ago, officials at the transitional justice bodies were appointed on the basis of quota from political parties.

According to sources, Deuba and Dahal dwelt mainly on the selection of new leadership in the two commissions during their meeting on Sunday.

A Nepali Congress leader confirmed to the Post that the two leaders had met but stopped short of divulging details.

“The discussion was on contemporary issues,” Ramesh Lekhak, who has been actively engaged in the peace process, told the Post. “It’s but natural.”

Lekhak and Minendra Rijal from the Congress party and Barsha Man Pun, a former Maoist leader, from the Nepal Communist Party were also present in the meeting. However, there was no representative from the former CPN-UML.

According to sources, during the meeting, Deuba and Dahal also focused on pressing Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to take initiatives to conclude the transitional justice process.

Deuba’s Congress party and Dahal’s Maoist party, which now has merged with the UML, are the two major political stakeholders in the transitional justice process.

When the Maoists waged a war against the state in 1996, which continued for 10 years, the Congress was in power and declared a state of emergency.

The highest number of cases of death and forceful disappearance took place during the emergency period. The top leadership of both the parties have cases registered with the two transitional justice commissions.

Despite repeated promises, the transitional justice process, however, has failed to make progress, leaving conflict victims increasingly worried. The government has to yet to amend the Transitional Justice Act in line with the Supreme Court ruling and international standards.

On Monday, conflict victims and human rights defenders protested in the Capital demanding that the new leadership in the transitional justice bodies be selected only after amending the Transitional Justice Act.

“We are pressing both the ruling and opposition parties to ensure that justice is delivered to thousands of victims at the earliest,” said Bhagiram Chaudhary of the Conflict Victims Common Platform, an organisation of conflict victims.

There are some concerns that Prime Minister Oli, who is also the co-chair of the ruling Nepal Communist Party, is not taking the desired steps to conclude the transitional justice process.

Oli, according to the people who have an understanding of the ongoing transitional justice process, is not enthusiastic to expedite the process, as he believes it is the issue that concerns the former Maoists and the Nepali Congress more.

“That’s why the Congress and Maoist leadership are working to find a common understanding so that pressure could be built on Oli,” a source familiar with the development told the Post on condition of anonymity citing sensitivity of the matter.

Amid dilly-dallying by the Nepali leadership, the international community time and again has put pressure on Nepal to conclude the transitional justice process by holding wider consultations and broader participation of the stakeholders.

Two weeks ago, five special rapporteurs under the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights wrote to the government demanding transparency in the selection of new leadership in the transitional justice bodies and an amendment to the Act.

The letter was shot to Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali days after he assured the international community in Geneva that Nepal would conclude the transitional justice process “soon” and that there would be no blanket amnesty.

Earlier in January, nine foreign missions in Kathmandu, at the initiative of the United Nations, asked the government to clarify its plans to take the transitional justice process forward in 2019 and ensure broader consultation with the stakeholders.

But there has been no response from the government except the usual refrain that “Nepal’s is a homegrown peace process and that the Nepali leadership is capable to conclude the transitional justice process on its own.”

Conflict victims say the government’s reluctance to amend the Transitional Justice Act in line with the Supreme Court ruling and international obligations shows it’s not willing to conclude the transitional justice process.

In 2015, the Supreme Court had struck down the amnesty provision and said the consent of the victims was necessary for any reconciliation.

“The government seems reluctant to conclude the transitional justice process,” said Chaudhary of the common platform.

The meeting between Deuba and Dahal on Sunday took place just a day after a team of conflict victims met the former to pressure him to take steps to expedite the investigation into war-era cases of human rights violations so as to ensure justice to the victims.

“The Congress and former Maoist leaders appear to be serious now,” the source told the Post. “Oli, however, doesn’t seem to be worried at all. The process can move ahead only if the two parties can build pressure on the government. The leaders have decided to continue discussions until they reach a meeting point.”

Both the leaders, according to the sources, were of the view that the more the transitional justice process is delayed, the more complex it will be.

“The parties must have a uniform position,” said Lekhak, the Congress leader, “for the early conclusion of the transitional justice process.",Kathmandu Post,2019-04-30

Leaders of both the parties, at a programme in the Capital, said the Samajbadi Party Nepal will strive to become a strong alternative political force in the country.

Baburam Bhattarai, who led the Naya Shakti Party-Nepal, will now head the federal council of the new party, while Upendra Yadav, who led the Sanghiya Samajbadi Forum-Nepal, will lead the central committee. The party’s statute, however, has given more executive power to Yadav than Bhattarai.

“We have already reached an agreement to launch our struggle for an amendment to the constitution,” said Bhattarai while addressing the unification programme. “Our struggle will be from the streets and Parliament.”

Similarly, Yadav warned what he called old parties to brace for a new movement in the country. “How can these old parties which always said federalism was not their agenda own it?” said Yadav, hinting at the Nepal Communist Party, or the former CPN-UML for that matter, and the Nepali Congress. The UML and CPN (Maoist Centre) had announced their merger last year to become the Nepal Communist Party.

“The old parties are trying to fail federalism,” said Yadav.

The newly formed party has said it will make a pitch for 10+1 province model and directly elected presidential system. The high-level restructuring commission of then Constituent Assembly had earlier recommended 10 geographical provinces and one non-territorial province for Dalits.

As of Monday, there was no clear indication whether the party would quit the government.

Since Upendra Yadav’s party is supporting the KP Sharma Oli government—Yadav himself is deputy prime minister and health minister—the new party has also become part of the government.

As both Bhattarai and Yadav have made constitution amendment one of the major agendas of the new party, leaders said they would withdraw support if the Oli government refuses to oblige.

“The government has given assurances that it would amend the constitution,” said Bhattarai. “But the party would launch a struggle anytime if the government fails to keep its word.” Yadav, however, did not talk about quitting the government.

With 17 members in Parliament—16 from Sanghiya Samajbadi Forum and one from Naya Shakti—the newly formed Samajbadi Party Nepal’s strength is on a par with Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal.

According to leaders, the Samajbadi Party Nepal will have 25 office bearers.

Ashok Rai will remain as a senior leader and Rajendra Shrestha as co-chair.

The party will have eight vice-chairpersons—Navaraj Subedi, Parshuram Khapung, Yubaraj Karki, Rakam Chemjong, Renu Kumari Yadav, Hisila Yami, Mohammad Lalbabu Raut and Hemraj Rai.

Similarly, there will be three general secretaries—Ganga Shrestha, Ranadhoj Kangdangwa and Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav and three deputy general secretaries—Dambar Khatiwada, Dan Bahadur Biswokarma and Prakash Adhikari. There will be six secretaries and a treasurer.

Amid leaders’ claim that the Samajbadi Party Nepal would become a strong alternative force, political observers, however, have expressed some scepticism.

Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, said Samajbadi Party Nepal may gain some strength and have some impact on national politics but it cannot become an alternative force in terms of character. “If they can bring Rastriya Janata Party also, they can become a significant political force to challenge the existing forces,” he told the Post.

Bhattarai and Yadav though seem to have found a common ground in constitution amendment, their unification basically emanates from different needs.

Yadav, who has seen a steady rise through identity politics, wanted to shed the tag of a Madhesi leader and establish himself as “national leader”. Bhattarai, on the other hand, had miserably failed in his bid to create what he called “new force”.

Another Political analyst Chandra Kishore termed the unity of the two parties a “marriage of convenience” between the two top leaders.

Bhattarai is a brand without organisation and Yadav was seeking forces that would make it easier for him to remain in power.

“Yadav is never tired of talking about social justice and inclusion but he is power hungry,” Kishore said.

As far as the “alternative force” is concerned, Kishore said, it has become one of the most sellable terms these days. “The new party has nothing to convince the people that they could create an alternative force,” he said. “What change did Bhattarai and Yadav bring when they were in power?",Kathmandu Post,2019-05-07

With most of Thapa’s supporters receiving the benefits—both in the government and the unified party—other leaders of the former Maoist faction have started expressing discontent within the party.

One of the senior-most leaders of the Maoist insurgents during the ‘people’s war’—which ended in 2006—Thapa has always been at the crucial decision-making level in the CPN (Maoist Centre) and also in the new party.

According to leaders, the only ministry allotted to the erstwhile Maoist Centre in the Province 1 government is led by Indra Aangbo of Thapa’s group while the deputy speaker of the provincial assembly, Saraswoti Pokhrel, was also from the same group.

Internal affairs and law ministers Hari Chuman (Gandaki Province) and Kul Prasad KC (Province 5) also represent Thapa’s group.

In the federal government, Thapa is leading one of the most crucial offices, the Home Ministry. Two other leaders from the now-dissolved Maoist party—Shakti Basnet and Barshaman Pun, who were in charge of the environment and finance ministries—now lead the forest and environment, and energy, water resources and irrigation ministries, respectively.

In the House of Representatives, Dev Prasad Gurung of the Thapa faction is the chief whip of the Nepal Communist Party (NCP).

Leaders said that many chairs of the parliamentary committees of provincial assemblies were given to Thapa supporters. Thapa also got many of his leaders as lawmakers as he led the three-member panel that selected the party’s candidates for the 2017 general election. Even the leaderships of provincial and district committees involve a significant number of Thapa’s men in the Maoist quota.

Some leaders believe that NCP Co-chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal was not bothered with the issue because he wanted to attract leaders to his camp while those close to Dahal were furious over the distribution of berths to those who once “betrayed the party” by splitting it.

While some leaders believe that Thapa’s group happened to get the maximum benefit in the state mechanism and also in the party just because they had more senior leaders in his group, many others complain of discrimination.

“It seems that the leaders should desert the party once to get better opportunity here,” said Hemraj Bhandari, a central committee member. “When the leaders who dumped the party for some interests get better opportunities, what message would that extend to the leaders supporting the party continuously?”

However, the role of Thapa was never been appreciated as he failed to take quick decisions. Therefore, some leaders believe that party Co-chair and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has been taking advantage of his ‘introvert’ nature. “Even Dahal was not for supporting Thapa as home minister,” said a Standing Committee member close to Dahal, adding that he was more a choice of Oli.

Dahal, threatened by his growing popularity during the decade-long insurgency, had taken action against Thapa but they were always together in the party after the Chunbang meeting that led the Maoist party towards the peace process.

However, later in 2012 Thapa sided with Baidya and split the party vertically, accusing Dahal of having betrayed the revolution. A year earlier, he had also sided with Mohan Baidya, Baburam Bhattarai and Narayan Kaji Shrestha in the Dhobighat incident that eventually elevated Bhattarai to the post of prime minister.

In 2016, Thapa, along with a majority of leaders in the Baidya-led party, returned to the mother party.

However, leaders coming from other factions—including one led by Netra Bikram Chand—have been “humiliated” and ignored. A group of leaders led by Tilak Pariyar had joined the Maoist mainstream deserting Chand’s party but Pariyar, who was included in the nine-member party secretariat, is just a central committee member along with Basanta Gharti Magar.

“We have sensed increasing factionalism in the party, which will neither create a party nor ensure justifiable inclusion,” Pariyar said, adding that the NCP leadership did not discuss with the groups joining the Maoist party any issues including the selection of the poll candidates, let alone other crucial issues.

However, leaders have urged the party leadership to settle the issues while forming the politburo and unified sister wings of the NCP. “Now the party can make some corrections,” said Pariyar.

Devendra Poudel, a standing committee member who joined the Maoist party deserting Baburam Bhattarai’s now-dissolved Naya Shakti Party, said that at the moment it seems like that most of the leaders from the Thapa faction have got more opportunities, but the issue should settle once the part unification process is over.",Kathmandu Post,2019-05-10

He lied.: House Speaker Mahara has explicitly ordered secretariat officials to delete ‘unparliamentary comments’ of opposition lawmakers and prime minister,"Upon his arrival from a weeklong visit to two Southeast Asian nations, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Wednesday told reporters that he did not make comments that were against parliamentary decorum while responding to queries of the main opposition in the House of Representatives on May 7.

“The [House] Speaker hasn’t said I used any unparliamentary words. Nor has he directed to remove them from the record,” Oli told the media at the Tribhuvan International Airport. “Some lawmakers had used indecent, provocative and unparliamentary words, and the Speaker’s directive was targeted at them.”

Oli went on to say that he was aware of the dignity and decorum of Parliament and that he has always maintained that.

But Oli’s claims are untrue, as Speaker Krishna Bahadur Mahara on May 10 issued a ruling, saying, “I direct the [Parliament] Secretariat to delete the unparliamentary words that were used [by lawmakers] while questioning the prime minister on policies and programmes and while [the prime minister] answered.”

Mahara explicitly said that remarks—both by lawmakers and the prime minister—would be deleted.

“Our team is studying the remarks made by lawmakers as well as Prime Minister Oli following the Speaker’s directive,” Roj Nath Pandey, spokesperson for the Parliament Secretariat, told the Post. “The phrases that need to be removed from the record will be ascertained after the study.”

Oli on May 7 was responding to questions around policies and programmes—presented by the President on May 3—raised by lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress.

“I am leaving aside some trivial comments emanating from anger and complexes and would rather address other concerns,” Oli had said, immediately drawing sharp criticism from the Congress lawmakers who demanded that Speaker Mahara issue a ruling, ordering the Parliament officials to remove those comments because they were unparliamentary.

But Mahara refused to oblige, which also earned him criticism from the main opposition that said the House Speaker had failed to rise above partisan interests and that he was siding with the government.

Mahara’s May 10 ruling, however, was for removing all those comments—by Oli and opposition lawmakers—that did not suit parliamentary decorum.

The Speaker’s ruling has not gone down well with lawmakers from the ruling Nepal Communist Party. They say Mahara acted in a hurry.

“It is clear that the Speaker fell prey to the Congress,” said Bishal Bhattarai, a lawmaker of the ruling party. “He issued an unwanted ruling just to pacify the opposition lawmakers.”

According to Bhattarai, the word “trivial” was used [by Oli] to indicate “unimportant” questions asked by opposition lawmakers, which were provocative.

Political scientists, however, do not agree with ruling party lawmakers.

“Addressing Parliament means addressing the sovereign people of the country as the parliamentarians represent the people because it’s the people who elect them,” said Meena Baidya Malla, a professor of political science, told the Post.

“Words that are not in line with the dignity and decorum of the House should not be allowed regardless of who uses them,” she said. “And as the head of the government, the prime minister should be more sensitive in such matters.",Kathmandu Post,2019-05-16
10,Politics,https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2019/05/25/house-committee-assures-to-revise-controversial-bill-to-amend-human-rights-law,House committee assures to revise ‘controversial’ bill to amend human rights law: Human rights committee chair says he will also work for revising Media Council Bill,"Following widespread criticism of the bill to amend the National Human Rights Commission Act-2012, a parliamentary committee has pledged to revise the controversial provisions in accordance with the spirit of the constitution and international practice.

The constitutional human rights watchdog and various human rights groups have been criticising the bill, which reduces the administrative and financial autonomy of the commission and makes it mandatory to recommend the cases it has investigated to the attorney general. The attorney general, according to the revision bill, bears full authority over whether or not to proceed the case. The existing Act authorises the commission to write directly to the respective agency to execute its recommendations made after the investigation.

The draft contradicts Article 293 of the constitution, which says constitutional commissions are accountable and answerable only to the federal parliament. Even parliamentary committees cannot give directives to the human rights commission. However, clause 17 (3) of the new bill proposes that the attorney general can request the commission for further investigation or collection of more evidence, if necessary, before deciding to register the case.

During a press meet at Singha Durbar on Friday, Krishna Bhakta Pokharel, chairman of the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of Parliament, said the bill will be revised after consultation with officials from the commission.

“The bill will have the same wording as in the constitution regarding the function, duties and powers of the commission,” Pokharel said. “I want to assure that the bill will be revised after seeking consensus with every stakeholder.”

The amendment bill, which has been registered in Parliament, will be sent to the Pokharel-led committee for finalisation. It will then be tabled for endorsement once the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee gives it a final shape following a discussion with lawmakers and the stakeholders concerned.

The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions lists the commission under category ‘A’. Nepal is among three countries in South Asia to receive the status. The revision process has begun while Nepal sits as an elected member in the United Nations Human Right Council and is eying a second term.

“We welcome the commitment of the parliamentary committee and now want to see its execution,” Govinda Sharma Paudyal, a member of the commission, told the Post.

The bill has got into a controversy since the Cabinet last month approved and registered it in the federal parliament secretariat for endorsement. The Cabinet finalised the bill by completely ignoring the 17-point recommendations from the commission despite repeated requests to incorporate them. Anup Raj Sharma, chairperson of the commission, in his meeting with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, had requested him to consider their recommendations. But Oli ignored them.

During his interaction with the media on Friday, Pokharel, who also is a central committee member of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP), said he would also take steps for revising the Media Council Bill.

“Media Council Act shouldn’t contradict with the spirit of the statute, which ensures full freedom to the press,” he said.

According to Pokharel, Subas Nembang, the deputy Parliamentary Party leader of the ruling communist party, has already assured that the bill will see necessary changes and the ruling party is committed to revising it.

The bill, which will replace the existing Press Council Act, aims to create a media council, providing it more authority to impose hefty fines on journalists and give the government more say in the hiring and firing of the council members.

Journalists and information rights activists have said the new council could increase direct attacks on the press. The Federation of Nepali Journalists has been protesting against the bill, demanding that the government immediately withdraw it from Parliament",Kathmandu Post,2019-05-25
