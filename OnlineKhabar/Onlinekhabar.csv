Of the lawmakers who served in the House dissolved last Bhadra, around 170 are not even in the race this time.

In some constituencies, outgoing lawmakers are competing against one another. Even if incumbent candidates manage to win in as many seats as possible, it is almost certain that more than two-thirds of the members, both from the direct and proportional systems, in the next House will be new faces.

“Yes, looking at the candidates and their backgrounds, it is clear that around two-thirds of those elected will be new,” says former Federal Parliament Secretary-General Manohar Prasad Bhattarai. “Even among those contesting now, not all incumbents will win. Many will exit politics through the election itself, which could further increase the number of new lawmakers.”

Of the 165 incumbent lawmakers elected through the direct system, 70 are not candidates this time. Among the 110 proportional representation lawmakers, at most only 10 are in the race. There is no guarantee that nearly all 100 incumbents elected in 2079 BS who are contesting again will win. Eight former lawmakers are competing against one another.

Several senior leaders from major parties are not contesting. In the Nepali Congress, former party president Sher Bahadur Deuba, former vice-president Dhanraj Gurung, and current vice-president Bishwo Prakash Sharma are not in the race. Leaders, including Prakash Man Singh and Arzu Rana, are also not contesting. In the UML, former deputy general secretary Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, Yogesh Bhattarai, and Bidya Bhattarai are out of the race.

In Jumla, Jhapa–2, Sarlahi–4, and Dhanusha–3, multiple incumbent lawmakers are competing against one another, meaning only one from each constituency will be elected. At least six incumbents from these areas will not return to the House.

In Jhapa–2, former Speaker Devraj Ghimire, Congress proportional lawmaker Sarita Prasain, and former Deputy Speaker Indira Rana Magar are contesting; two of them will not make it to the House. In Sarlahi–4, only one of the Congress leaders, Gagan Thapa and the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) candidate, Amresh Kumar Singh, will become a lawmaker.

In Dhanusha–3, UML incumbent Juli Kumari Mahato, Congress proportional lawmaker Bimalendra Nidhi, and RSP incumbent Manish Jha are competing; only one will return after Falgun 21. In Jumla, at least one of RPP’s Gyanendra Bahadur Shahi and RSP’s Binita Kathayat will fail to enter the House.

None of the UML lawmakers elected through proportional representation last time are on either the direct or proportional lists this time. However, those elected before 2079 BS have sought safety on proportional lists.

Ram Bahadur Thapa, who was not in the House after the new constitution, is on the proportional list, while Padma Aryal, elected in 2074 BS, also appears on the list. UML, Congress, and RSP did not repeat their previous proportional lists.

From Congress, only Dr Prakash Sharan Mahat and Bimalendra Nidhi from the previous proportional list are in direct contests. In the Maoist Centre and other allied groups forming the NCP, the proportional lists also feature new faces.

From the RSP, six lawmakers previously elected through proportional representation are now contesting direct seats, including Dol Prasad Aryal (Kathmandu–9), Nisha Dangi (Jhapa–1), Binita Kathayat (Jumla), Indira Rana Magar (Jhapa–2), and Manish Jha (Dhanusha–3). Former RSP member Santosh Pariyar is on the proportional list of the Progressive Democratic Party, while Sumana Shrestha is not contesting this time.

In Taplejung, UML has fielded Kshitij Thebe in place of former lawmaker Yogesh Bhattarai. In Panchthar, Aindra Sundar Nembang replaces Basanta Nembang. In Ilam–1, Kaji Man Kagate has been nominated instead of former UML lawmaker Mahesh Basnet.

In Jhapa–1, Congress has nominated Keshav Raj Pandey in place of former vice-president Bishwo Prakash Sharma. In the remaining four Jhapa constituencies, previously elected candidates are contesting again.

In Sankhuwasabha, Tehrathum, and Bhojpur, Congress and the Maoist Centre did not field their previously elected lawmakers. Congress nominated Dipan Kumar Shrestha instead of Dipak Khadka in Sankhuwasabha, Santosh Subba instead of Sita Gurung in Tehrathum, and the unified NCP nominated Ajambar Rai instead of Sudan Kirati in Bhojpur.

In Morang, two incumbent lawmakers are not contesting. Congress nominated Khadga Bahadur Phago instead of Dig Bahadur Limbu in Morang–1, while UML nominated Dilip Kumar Agrawal instead of Rishikesh Pokharel in Morang–2.

In Sunsari–1, the Janata Samajwadi Party did not field a candidate to replace Ashok Rai, while in Sunsari–2 UML nominated Sujan Lama instead of Bhim Acharya.

In Solukhumbu, Khotang, and Okhaldhunga, previously elected lawmakers are not contesting. UML nominated Kalpana Rai instead of Manbir Rai in Solukhumbu, while Hari Roka received the ticket in place of the Maoist Centre’s Ram Kumar Rai. In Okhaldhunga, Congress nominated Kumar Luintel instead of Ram Hari Khatiwada.

In Udayapur–1, Congress nominated Bidur Basnet instead of Dr Narayan Khadka. In Saptari–1, Shyam Sundar Sardar is contesting in place of former JSP lawmaker Naval Kishor Sah Sudi.

In Siraha, all four constituencies have incumbent lawmakers contesting, but two have changed constituencies or parties. In Siraha–2, Raj Kishor Yadav has moved to Siraha–4, while Birendra Prasad Mahato is contesting from Siraha–4 under the Janamat Party.

In Dolakha, Ramechhap, and Sindhuli–1, previously elected lawmakers are not contesting. In Sindhuli–2, only NCP’s Lekhnath Dahal is repeating.

In Mahottari, three of four constituencies have former lawmakers contesting. In Mahottari–3, Mahanta Thakur is set to become a National Assembly member, ensuring a new face in the House.

In Bagmati Province’s Rasuwa, Dhading, and Nuwakot, incumbents are contesting, except in Dhading–2 where Congress nominated Ramesh Prasad Dhamala instead of Ram Nath Adhikari. In Nuwakot–2, Congress lawmaker Arjun Nar Singh KC is on the proportional list.

Of the 15 constituencies in the Kathmandu Valley, at least five will elect new lawmakers as incumbents are not contesting. Congress nominated Prabal Thapa instead of Prakash Man Singh in Kathmandu–1. In Kathmandu–2, RSP lawmaker Sobita Gautam is contesting from Chitwan–3.

Congress has fielded new candidates in Kathmandu–3, Kathmandu–10, and Bhaktapur–2. UML nominated Ajay Kranti Shakya instead of Krishna Gopal Shrestha in Kathmandu–9. Lalitpur’s three constituencies still have incumbents contesting.

Both constituencies in Kavre will see new lawmakers, as Surya Man Dong and Gokul Baskota are not contesting. In Sindhupalchok–2, Congress nominated Banshalal Tamang instead of Mohan Basnet.

In Kaski, UML did not re-nominate incumbents in two constituencies, fielding Bain Bahadur Chhetri in Kaski–1 and Rashmi Acharya in Kaski–2. In Tanahun, both incumbents are contesting again.

In Syangja, Congress has fielded Bharatraj Dhakal and Bhagwat Prakash Mall as new candidates. In Arghakhanchi, UML nominated Pitambar Bhusal after Top Bahadur Rayamajhi was jailed in a fake refugee case.

In Rupandehi, new faces are almost certain in three of five constituencies. UML nominated Dadhiram Neupane instead of Chhabilal Bishwakarma in Rupandehi–1, while Bishnu Poudel is contesting in Constituency 2.

Several incumbents across Kapilvastu, Nawalparasi, and other districts are not contesting, ensuring new representation.

Former Secretary-General Bhattarai says that even with a large number of new lawmakers, parliamentary procedures can be learned quickly through practice and study.

“Concerns that parliamentary practice will weaken with new lawmakers are nothing new,” he says. “Past experience shows that those with strong oratory skills and political grounding adapt quickly. Active lawmakers can become effective within four to six months.”

He adds that an influx of new lawmakers could help curb parliamentary distortions and strengthen discipline, provided party leadership enforces accountability and refrains from protecting those involved in criminal activities.

“Publicly questioning old lawmakers exiting and new ones entering can raise hopes for controlling parliamentary malpractice,” he says. “Whether this becomes an opportunity for political cleansing depends largely on party leadership and how responsibly they guide their representatives.”",OnlineKhabar,2026-01-26
2,Politics,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/baburam-bhattarai-withdraws-candidacy.html,Baburam Bhattarai withdraws candidacy,"Former Prime Minister Dr Baburam Bhattarai has decided to withdraw his candidacy. Bhattarai, who was a candidate from Gorkha-2, decided after holding discussions today with several leaders close to him.

He had filed his candidacy on behalf of the Progressive Democratic Party.

According to sources at his secretariat, the decision was made after Nepal Communist Party coordinator Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’, Nepali Congress candidate Prakash Chandra Dawadi, and Rastriya Swatantra Party Vice Chair Swarnim Wagle, among others, requested him to play a guardian-like role and facilitate consensus. Bhattarai will formally withdraw his candidacy today through a legal representative.

Bhattarai has previously been elected from Gorkha-2. In the 2079 BS election, he had supported Prachanda and stated that he would not contest. This time as well, he had repeatedly said he would not run in the election, but decided to do so just two days before the nomination and travelled to Gorkha. He has not disclosed whom he will support after withdrawing his candidacy.

Candidates in Gorkha-2 include Prakash Chandra Dawadi of the Nepali Congress, Milan Gurung (Milan Chakre) of the CPN-UML, Kabindra Burlakoti, General Secretary of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, among others.",OnlineKhabar,2026-01-23

The Indian Embassy handed over the cabin pickup vans to the Nepal government during a program held at Singha Durbar on Magh 6. The vehicles are currently parked in front of the Ministry of Home Affairs at Singha Durbar.

The Ministry of Home Affairs had requested vehicles from the Government of India through the Ministry of Finance as material assistance for election purposes. Under the proposal, India has provided 61 vehicles as a gift to the Nepal government in the first phase.

For this election, the Government of India is reported to be providing a total of 538 vehicles of various sizes. As the vehicles have been registered in the name of the Government of Nepal, the government will be able to use them as needed after the election.

The Government of India has been providing assistance to the Government of Nepal, including vehicles and other election equipment, to help conduct elections.",OnlineKhabar,2026-01-27
4,Politics,https://english.onlinekhabar.com/18-new-members-elected-to-national-assembly.html,18 new members elected to National Assembly,"Eighteen new faces have been elected to the National Assembly, including a mix of experienced leaders, first-time parliamentarians, youth, and representatives from inclusive groups.

Elections were held on Sunday for 18 of the 19 seats whose terms are set to expire on Falgun 20. The Nepali Congress, CPN-UML, and Loktantrik Samajwadi Party (LSP) contested the election in alliance, while the Nepal Communist Party contested independently. Candidates backed by the alliance emerged victorious.

Members of provincial assemblies and chiefs and deputy chiefs of local governments serve as voters in National Assembly elections. Across all seven provinces, there are 550 provincial assembly members. Among local levels, there are 1,506 voters, including mayors, chairpersons, and their deputies from 753 local units. The term of the newly elected National Assembly members will begin on 21 Falgun.

Several of those elected on Sunday have previously served in the House of Representatives, while others are completely new to parliamentary politics.

Those elected to the National Assembly who have previously served as members of the House of Representatives include Mahanta Thakur, Ram Kumari Jhakri, Sunil Bahadur Thapa, and Lalit Jung Shahi.

Eighty-three-year-old Mahanta Thakur, elected from Madhesh Province, was a member of the dissolved House of Representatives. A multiple-time lower house lawmaker, he has entered the National Assembly in the later phase of his political career.

Thakur entered parliamentary politics in 1991 after winning the election from Sarlahi Constituency No. 5 as a Nepali Congress candidate and later served as deputy speaker. He won again from Sarlahi in the 1994 mid-term election. He lost in the 2008 election but became a lawmaker through cabinet nomination. He was defeated again in 2013 but won elections from Mahottari-3 in 2017 and 2022. This time, he has moved from the House of Representatives to the National Assembly.

Ram Kumari Jhakri, elected from Lumbini Province, is also a former member of the House of Representatives. She was elected under the proportional representation system in 2017 but lost the 2022 election. She has now been elected to the National Assembly.

Born on May 10, 1978, in Gulmi, Jhakri rose to prominence through student politics under ANNFSU.

From Karnali Province, Lalit Jung Shahi is a former Constituent Assembly member. Born on November 15, 1955, he is a resident of Chandannath Municipality-5, Khalanga, Jumla.

Influenced by the ideology of BP Koirala, Shahi has been active in politics for decades. He unsuccessfully contested the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008 as a rebel candidate against his own party’s nominee but remained in the party. He was elected from Jumla in the second Constituent Assembly election in 2013 and played a role in drafting the Constitution of Nepal 2015. He lost the 2022 provincial assembly election but has now been elected to the National Assembly. After his election, Shahi pledged to help bring the constitution back on track, saying it had deviated from its intended course.

Sunil Bahadur Thapa, elected unopposed to the National Assembly from Koshi Province, is the son of former prime minister Surya Bahadur Thapa.

The 66-year-old has prior experience as a federal lawmaker and minister. He was directly elected to the Constituent Assembly from Dhankuta-2 in 2013 as a Rastriya Prajatantra Party candidate. In May 2017, he served as Minister for Commerce and Supplies in Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba’s cabinet.

However, the last two House of Representatives elections were unsuccessful for Thapa. He lost the 2017 and 2022 elections from Dhankuta to UML’s Rajendra Kumar Rai. He left RPP in 2020 and joined the Nepali Congress, later becoming a central committee member through the party’s 14th general convention. From Chaitra 2079 BS to Chaitra 2082 BS, he served as chief political adviser to President Ram Chandra Paudel.

Thapa was elected unopposed after his main rival, Nepal Communist Party candidate Hemraj Ghimire, failed to reach the election officer’s office on time during nomination registration on Poush 23.

Born on April 13, 1959, in Pakhribas, Dhankuta, Thapa previously worked in various countries under the United Nations. He entered active politics after resigning from his post at the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Sudan.

Another National Assembly member elected from Koshi Province is Roshni Meche, who represents the marginalised Meche community.

Rosani defeated Nepal Communist Party candidate Namita Nyaupane in Sunday’s election. With her victory, the door has opened for her to take the lead in shaping federal policies related to marginalised communities.

The Meche community, which resides in areas including Mechinagar, Birtamod, Haldibari, and Kachankawal in Jhapa, currently receives a monthly social security allowance of Rs 4,000. Rosani’s election is considered a moment of pride for the community.

She previously worked at the secretariat of then prime minister KP Sharma Oli. A resident of Mechinagar-12, Jhapa, Rosani entered politics through the UML-affiliated Democratic Indigenous Nationalities Federation. She holds a master’s degree in sociology and a bachelor’s degree in law. Over the next six years, she plans to raise the voices of marginalised and minority communities in the federal parliament.

Apart from Mahanta Thakur, three others have been elected to the National Assembly from Madhesh Province: Dharmendra Paswan and Ranjit Karn of the Nepali Congress, and Rekha Jha of CPN-UML.

Dharmendra Paswan is a Dalit rights activist known for raising his voice against discrimination, injustice, and exclusion. The 54-year-old leader from Rautahat is regarded as disciplined, people-oriented, and living a simple lifestyle. He studied political science up to the bachelor’s level and has experience working with various non-governmental organisations. He has also served as general secretary of the Dalit Association and has pledged to work for the economic and social development of the Dalit community during his tenure.

Ranjit Karn is a former central president of the Nepal Students’ Union. A resident of Rajbiraj, he has been active in the Nepali Congress since his student days and was elected under the minority quota from Madhesh Province.

Rekha Jha of CPN-UML has also been elected to the National Assembly from Madhesh.

Newly elected member Som Portal says he will raise youth-related issues in the National Assembly. Elected from Koshi Province under the Dalit cluster, Portal said he would advocate for both Dalit concerns and youth issues, as mandated by his party.

He noted that the National Assembly was previously viewed mainly as a chamber to honour senior and experienced leaders, but stressed the need for meaningful youth participation. Portal began his political journey at the ward committee level and worked through local, district, and provincial responsibilities before reaching the National Assembly.

Born in Falgun 2035 BS, Portal has experience in local governance and development and served as chair of the Jhapa District Coordination Committee from 2017 to 2022.

From Bagmati Province, Geeta Devkota of the Nepali Congress and Dr Prem Dangal of CPN-UML have been elected. Dangal, a UML central committee member, is a resident of Gokarneshwar-5, Kathmandu. He has worked in various roles within ANNFSU and party committees and previously served as chair of the All Nepal Peasants’ Federation. He has led regional farmers’ organisations and authored several books on food sovereignty, neoliberalism, climate change, sustainable development, and the Nepali farmers’ movement.

Devkota, born in 1971, has been active in politics since 1987 through the Nepal Students’ Union. She was elected a central committee member of the Nepali Congress at its 14th general convention and currently serves as vice-chair of the Beekeepers Farmers Federation.

From Gandaki Province, Jagat Timilsina of the Nepali Congress and Smriti Devkota of CPN-UML have been elected.

Timilsina was a lecturer at Tribhuvan University’s management faculty and has served as president of the Congress-affiliated Democratic Professors’ Association since 2016. A resident of Shuklagandaki-7, Tanahun, he had not previously held a party post.

Smriti Devkota entered the National Assembly after losing three consecutive elections. She had contested the 2017 local election as a UML candidate for deputy mayor of Gorkha Municipality and the 2022 mayoral election from the same municipality, but lost both. She was again nominated for the National Assembly election in 2024 and has now succeeded.

From Lumbini Province, Vasudev Jangali and Chandra Bahadur KC of the Nepali Congress have been elected. Jangali hails from Dang, while KC is from Gulmi.

From Karnali Province, Lalit Jung Shahi of the Nepali Congress and Mina Rakhal of CPN-UML have been elected. Rakhal, a resident of Dailekh, was a proportional representation member of the Karnali Provincial Assembly in 2017 and later became a UML central committee member through the party’s 11th general convention.

From Sudurpaschim Province, Khamba Bahadur Khati of the Nepali Congress and Leela Bhandari of CPN-UML have been elected. Khati is a former general secretary of the Nepal Bar Association and a former attorney general, while Bhandari is a leader with a Maoist background.",OnlineKhabar,2026-01-27
